# XXX timf this is just a placeholder for now, expecting we might
# need to do some sort of minio configuration at some point.


#
# Updates configuration files for Minio and enables/refreshes/clears
# the SMF service as necessary.
#
# This is run from two contexts:
# - From the config-agent "minio" manifest `post_cmd`
#   (see "/opt/triton/minio/sapi_manifests/minio").
# - On first boot, to write the initial prometheus config
#
# Running it directly is supported as well.
